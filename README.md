there's macos executable in this repo.
This program, is written for renaming pictures by its created time.
You will be able to select a folder, and select a number, for example, you take pictures of products, and each product has 5 pictures.
You can fill in 5 at the input box. 
feel free to translate those characters to english. I assume that it's simple enough for you to guess all the buttons as the function
of this program is easy. 


## Story behind this
Story behind this is that a friend of mine works with fashion design. And He takes pictures of clothes such as front-side, back-side and etc.
He finds it taking lots of his time to rename those pictures. So he reached out and I wrote this.
